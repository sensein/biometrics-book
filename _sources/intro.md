# Welcome to the Biometrics Book

This book is designed as a comprehensive guide that brings together various tools and techniques in biometrics, such as voice and speech processing. It aims to serve as a valuable resource for both beginners and advanced readers interested in this area of research.

## Purpose of the Book

The primary objective of this book is twofold:

1. **Illustrate Tools and Techniques**: We introduce and explain a wide range of tools, techniques, and methodologies used in voice and speech processing. From basic concepts to advanced techniques, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of how different tools can be used to analyze and process voice and speech data.

2. **Build a Descriptive Understanding**: Alongside the technical aspects, this book also focuses on building a descriptive understanding of voice and speech processing. We focus on human speech and how it can be analyzed using computational methods.
