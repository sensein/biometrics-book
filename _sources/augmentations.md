# Synthetic Generation (for augmentations for audio, noise insertion)

Synthetic generation plays a pivotal role in enhancing voice and speech datasets, especially when real-world data is scarce or noisy. This section covers methods for creating synthetic audio data, including techniques for augmenting existing datasets with various noise profiles and other transformations. These strategies not only improve model robustness but also expand the diversity of training data, leading to more resilient and adaptable speech systems.

One powerful tool for audio data augmentation is the `audiomentations` Python library. This library provides a wide range of techniques to transform audio data, such as adding noise, changing pitch, and applying time stretch. By leveraging `audiomentations`, researchers can create diverse training datasets that help models become more robust and adaptable to real-world audio variations.
