# Metrics

Metrics are the backbone of assessing the quality and effectiveness of speech processing systems. This section will explore the various metrics used to evaluate aspects like speech recognition accuracy, speaker identification, and the intelligibility of synthesized speech. Detailed discussions on word error rate, precision, F1 scores, and more will help researchers choose the right metrics for their specific needs.
